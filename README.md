# LRU_Chace
A simple implementation of a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache, which requires a 

This is a simple implementation of a LRU Cache using the collections module.
It has been designed to have a O(1) time complexity and an O(n) space complexity, where n is the capacity of the cache. The cache capacity is defined in the initialisation of the LRU_cache class
